How to test Pasteque
====================

You must have phpunit installed. See https://phpunit.de for installation.

Copy ../config/test-config-sample.ini to ../config/test-config.ini and set it to point
to an empty test database. To be able to test http routes, you must also point to
this instance and create a test user for Pasteque.

Run the full test suite by calling from the tests directory
$phpunit -c testsuites.xml

Tests are grouped for each layer of the API, one building upon the previous.
To test each layer separately use one of the following commands:
$ phpunit -c testsuites.xml --testsuite System
$ phpunit -c testsuites.xml --testsuite Model
$ phpunit -c testsuites.xml --testsuite API
$ phpunit -c testsuites.xml --testsuite http

You can run a single test by calling it with phpunit
$ phpunit <directory>/<test file>

To test the fiscal mirror mode, use testsuitesfm.xml. Make sure your config.ini files
sets the server mode to the fiscal mirror mode.

Be sure the database is in the good state to begin the tests. Use doctrine
to erase/set up the database with orm:schema-tool:drop and create.
$ php vendor/bin/doctrine orm:schema-tool:drop
$ php vendor/bin/doctrine orm:schema-tool:create

Writing new tests
=================

All tests must be named *Test.php to be automatically included in the test suites.
Put the test file in the according directory.
